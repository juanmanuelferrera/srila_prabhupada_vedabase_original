This collection of all of Srila Prabhupada work, is meant to honour him by preserving his teachings in the originally published form, not changing what he has written to make it appear more effective or politically correct. 

There should be no confusion between the work written by His Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada and edited by Howard Wheeler and the posthumous cent percent revised copy proposed by Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International. 

By changing Prabhupada's books without explicitly saying so, they do a discredit to Srila Prabhupada devotees and scholars. 

At present, it appears that the revisions were made by the original author. This collection is meant to be a means to carefully preserve Prabhupada's books for future generations.
