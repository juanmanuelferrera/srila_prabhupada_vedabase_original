This collection of all of Srila Prabhupada's work, is meant to honour him by preserving his teachings in the originally published form, not changing what he has written to make it appear more effective or politically correct. 

There should be no confusion between the work written by His Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada and edited by Howard Wheeler and the posthumous cent percent revised copy proposed by Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International.
